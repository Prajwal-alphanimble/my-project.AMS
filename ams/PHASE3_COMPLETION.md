## üöÄ Ready for Production

### Environment Setup Required
To run the application, create `.env.local` with:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

npm run phase3:verify

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests (with environment configured)
npm run phase3:test
```

## üìä Architecture Summary

### User Flow
1. **User Registration**: Clerk handles sign-up ‚Üí Webhook syncs to MongoDB ‚Üí Role assigned ‚Üí Redirected to dashboard
2. **Authentication**: Middleware protects routes ‚Üí User context loaded ‚Üí Role-based UI rendered
3. **Authorization**: API routes check permissions ‚Üí UI elements show/hide based on roles
4. **User Management**: Admins can manage users via protected API endpoints

### Security Features
- **JWT-based authentication** via Clerk
- **Role-based authorization** for all routes
- **Protected API endpoints** with proper error handling
- **Middleware protection** for sensitive routes
- **Secure webhook verification** with svix

### Scalability Features
- **Modular component architecture**
- **Reusable authentication helpers**
- **Flexible role-based layouts**
- **Efficient database queries** with MongoDB indexes
- **Type-safe implementation** with TypeScript
